ROLE:You are an expert data analyst with deep domain knowledge in industrial systems, specifically power generation equipment. Your primary skill is in cleaning and standardizing messy, legacy data by understanding the underlying context and intent.PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:Your task is to thoughtfully analyze and correct a list of equipment descriptions from a coal-fired power plant. You must go beyond simple rule-based replacements. First, you will learn from a set of provided examples, and then you will apply that understanding to a larger dataset. Your final output must include your reasoning for each suggested change.STEP 1: CONTEXT AND LEARNINGBefore you begin, you must understand the context. The data contains errors from a legacy system import and previous, flawed find-and-replace attempts.Your first task is to study the "Sample Original Data.csv" file. This file contains three crucial columns for your learning:Equipment Number: The unique ID.Original Description: The raw, error-filled text.Updated Description: A manually corrected version that serves as your "ground truth."From this sample file, you must learn the correction patterns. Pay close attention to:Good Corrections (Patterns to Emulate):AIR PREHEATER -> Air Preheater (Proper casing).DC PANEL SWITCH -> Dc Panel Switch (Contextual casing; "DC" should remain capitalized).ACCESSORY EQUIPMENT -> Accessory Equipment (Simple formatting).#3 WELL... -> #3 Well... (Correcting case while preserving special characters).Bad Corrections (Patterns to Avoid and Fix):A simple N becoming North. For example, a description like "Fa n" was incorrectly changed to "Fa North". Your rule should be: only expand N, S, E, W if they appear to be standalone directional indicators.A simple P becoming Pump.Partial word replacements. For example, "Press ure" becoming "Pressure Ure". You must be able to identify these nonsensical appended fragments and remove them.Misinterpreting spaced-out letters. For example, "Pres s" might have become "Pressure South". You need to recognize that "Pres s" was likely intended to be "Press." or "Pressure".STEP 2: ANALYSIS AND EXECUTIONNow that you have learned the patterns, your main task is to process the primary data file: "Equipment Data.csv".For each row in this file, you will analyze the Equipment Description column. You should also use the Object Type column for additional context if it helps clarify an ambiguous description.For each description, you will perform the following thoughtful analysis:Normalization: Apply basic, high-confidence cleaning (trim whitespace, fix multiple spaces, apply appropriate title casing).Pattern Recognition: Based on what you learned from the sample file, identify and correct common errors like partial words, incorrect abbreviations, and spaced-out words.Contextual Correction: Apply your understanding of the "bad correction" patterns. Scrutinize every potential correction to ensure it makes sense in the context of power plant equipment. Does "Fa North" make sense? No. Does "Boiler North" make sense? Yes. This is where your AI judgment is critical.Confidence Assessment: For each suggested change, assign a confidence score from 1 to 100.95-100: Trivial changes like whitespace or casing.80-94: High-confidence changes based on clear patterns from the learning file (e.g., correcting "Press ure").60-79: Medium-confidence changes where you are making an educated guess based on context (e.g., deciding "N" means "North").Below 60: Low-confidence changes for highly ambiguous entries.Reasoning Documentation: For every single change you suggest, you MUST provide a brief, clear note explaining why you made the change.STEP 3: OUTPUT FORMATYour final output must be a table in CSV format with the following columns:Equipment Number (The SAP ID from the main data file)Original Description (The original Equipment Description from the main data file)Suggested Edit (Your proposed new description. If no change is needed, leave this blank.)Confidence (Your 1-100 score.)Reasoning (Your notes explaining the change. e.g., "Corrected casing and removed stray 'Ure' fragment from a partial word replacement.")Begin the analysis now.
