## Date: 2025-09-24

### Context
- User requested a Python-first, AI-visible simulation of the Sootblower search mode, matching the real Excel data structure.
- The Sootblower Data table (Table1, Sheet: Sootblower Data) has the following columns: Type, Number, Floor, Side, SB Cabinet, Cabinet Floor, Cabinet side.
- User emphasized: No assumptions, no invented data, only real columns and values.

### Actions Taken
1. **Initial Python Simulation**
   - Created `sootblower_number_search.py` to simulate searching for a Sootblower by number.
   - Initial sample data included invented fields (Location, PowerSupply, etc.) and invalid values (Boiler 2, Floor 2, Side B, Panel B).
   - User flagged these as incorrect and requested strict adherence to real data structure.

2. **Correction and Data Structure Alignment**
   - Extracted the true Sootblower Data table structure from `Workbook_Metadata.txt` and project documentation.
   - Updated the Python simulation to use only the columns: Type, Number, Floor, Side, SB Cabinet, Cabinet Floor, Cabinet side.
   - Removed all invented or assumed fields and values.
   - Noted that no real data rows were available; placeholder rows were used only for code proof, not for simulation or display.

3. **User Feedback and Lessons Learned**
   - User clarified the importance of not inventing data and only using the real table structure.
   - Agent now waits for real data rows before simulating or displaying any results.
   - All future simulations will use only the exact columns and values from the real Excel table.

### Key Lessons
- Never assume or invent data structure or values; always extract from project metadata or user-provided samples.
- Document every step, correction, and lesson in the development log for full traceability.
- Python simulation is only valid if it matches the real Excel table structure exactly.

### Next Steps
- **COMPLETE**: Real Sootblower data provided by user for all sections (IK, IR, WB, IKAH).
- **COMPLETE**: Python simulation updated to include all 4 sections with correct data structure.
- **COMPLETE**: Search across all types proven working (e.g., Number 102 → WB102, Number 27 → IK27+IR27, Number 75 → IK75+WB75).
- **STATUS**: Python-first simulation is PROVEN and matches real Excel data exactly.
- Ready for VBA conversion or further feature extension as requested by user.
