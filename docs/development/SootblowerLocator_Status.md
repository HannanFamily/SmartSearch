# Project Status Summary - September 28, 2025

## Current Status
Sootblower Locator form and logic are implemented with reliable event binding. Design-time form is preferred, with a dynamic fallback if needed.

## Recent Implementations

1. **UserForm Development**
   - Created `frmSootblowerLocator.frm` with complete UI design
   - Added corresponding `frmSootblowerLocator.txt` with code reference and setup instructions
   - Implemented form features including:
     - Number input with validation (digits only)
     - Group filtering options (All Types, Retracts, Wall)
     - Action buttons (Search, Show All, Associated, Close)
     - Status indicators and results display

2. **Form Creation System**
    - `SootblowerFormCreator.bas` builds a runtime form and wires events
    - Multi-level instantiation approach:
       1. Prefer design-time form (`frmSootblowerLocator`)
       2. Fallback to dynamic creator via `SootblowerFormCreator`
       3. Final fallback: simple MsgBox

3. **Module Updates**
   - `EnsureSootblowerForm` in `mod_SootblowerLocator.bas`
   - Converted single-line ElseIf to multi-line If/ElseIf blocks (VBE parser fix)
   - `C_SSB_FormEvents` class ensures WithEvents handlers persist and fire reliably
   - Diagnostics enhanced throughout

4. **Documentation**
   - Added comprehensive form documentation in `docs/SootblowerLocatorForm.md`
   - Included usage instructions and implementation options

## Next Steps

1. Validate on Dashboard: final smoke test and basic SSB searches
2. Optional polish: layout tweaks and status text
3. Document custom ModeConfig entry and any special columns
4. Add a screenshot into `docs/image/SootblowerLocatorForm/` (done) and link here

## Current Issues
- No known blocking issues; report any edge-case UI regressions

## Module Relationships
- `mod_SootblowerLocator.bas` - Main logic module that calls and integrates with the form
- `frmSootblowerLocator.frm` - Primary form definition (needs importing into Excel)
- `SootblowerFormCreator.bas` - Dynamic form generator as fallback
- Supporting diagnostic and logging functionality in main module

When you're ready to continue, we'll focus on troubleshooting these modules and ensuring the form works correctly.
