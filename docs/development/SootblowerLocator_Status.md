# Project Status Summary - September 27, 2025

## Current Status
We're implementing the Sootblower Locator functionality with a UserForm interface. We've created the necessary files and modules but need to troubleshoot them to ensure they work correctly.

## Recent Implementations

1. **UserForm Development**
   - Created `frmSootblowerLocator.frm` with complete UI design
   - Added corresponding `frmSootblowerLocator.txt` with code reference and setup instructions
   - Implemented form features including:
     - Number input with validation (digits only)
     - Group filtering options (All Types, Retracts, Wall)
     - Action buttons (Search, Show All, Associated, Close)
     - Status indicators and results display

2. **Form Creation System**
   - Created `SootblowerFormCreator.bas` module for dynamic form creation at runtime
   - Implemented multi-level form instantiation approach:
     1. First tries standard form from .frm file
     2. Then tries dynamic creation via SootblowerFormCreator
     3. Falls back to simple dialog box if neither works

3. **Module Updates**
   - Added `EnsureSootblowerForm` function to mod_SootblowerLocator.bas
   - Updated form display logic in Init_SootblowerLocator
   - Enhanced error handling and diagnostic logging throughout

4. **Documentation**
   - Added comprehensive form documentation in `docs/SootblowerLocatorForm.md`
   - Included usage instructions and implementation options

## Next Steps

1. **Troubleshooting**
   - Test the form creation and display in Excel
   - Verify form functionality and integration with search logic
   - Debug any issues with dynamic form creation or event handling

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test full workflow from search input to results display
   - Verify all filter options work correctly
   - Test associated equipment functionality

3. **Optimization**
   - Review and optimize form code
   - Ensure proper error handling throughout
   - Finalize diagnostic logging

4. **Documentation**
   - Update any documentation based on testing results
   - Add screenshots of the working form to documentation

## Current Issues
- Need to verify if the form loads properly within Excel
- Need to test event handling between form and search module
- Need to confirm the dynamic form creation works as a fallback
- May need adjustments to form styling or control positioning

## Module Relationships
- `mod_SootblowerLocator.bas` - Main logic module that calls and integrates with the form
- `frmSootblowerLocator.frm` - Primary form definition (needs importing into Excel)
- `SootblowerFormCreator.bas` - Dynamic form generator as fallback
- Supporting diagnostic and logging functionality in main module

When you're ready to continue, we'll focus on troubleshooting these modules and ensuring the form works correctly.
