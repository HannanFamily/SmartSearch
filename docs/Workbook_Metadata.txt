=== Dev Notes Worksheet ===
Date	Type	Item	Description	Status	Priority Sorter	Group	Column1	
09/13/2025 03:35	Config	Switch static Column results output to reference ConfigTable	ConfigKey: Out_Column1, Out_Column2… Type: Output Column Selection	Completed	1	Config Vars	Now can you help me code the outArr() so that it resizes and fills the array based on the number of values in the "Output Column Selection" category in the ConfigTable "Type" column that have a value in the ConfigValue column. The config keys are structured like Out_Column<#>. 	
09/13/2025 03:36	Config	Set up Config Named variable system		Completed	1	Config Vars		
09/12/2025 23:15	Universal Function Template	Encryption/Decryption Tool with secret key	Based on custom list of named ranges or fallback to selection if no items in list  	Future	8			
09/12/2025 23:18	Tool	Tool to Export ALL data into 1 file readable by AI (maybe txt md) Should be highly formatted with description of format at start. 	Elements: Sheets: Name + CSV + any object type/name info VBA: Mod Code, ws code, wb code Data: All Named ranges + their scope + all instances referenced.	Future	1	Conversion		
09/12/2025 23:18	Tool	Tool to Export spreadsheet separate from VBA Code and appending _yymmdd_hmm 		Future	2	Conversion
