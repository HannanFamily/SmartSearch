# Development Log - Smart Search Dashboard Project

## September 17, 2025

### Project Setup and Repository Migration
1. **Initial Project Structure Review**
   - Analyzed existing VBA modules and worksheet structure
   - Identified key components: Dashboard.cls, ModeDrivenSearch, ConfigTableTools
   - Created comprehensive metadata export functionality

2. **Documentation and AI Instructions**
   - Created `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for AI assistance
   - Documented project architecture, patterns, and workflows
   - Added module consolidation strategy for development phase
   - Emphasized extensive inline documentation requirements

3. **Version Control Setup**
   - Initially created repository under HannanFamily/SmartSearch
   - Migrated to ShuaHannan/SearchProject for better organization
   - Set up Git workflow in multiple environments:
     - Local development environment
     - Code-server on Unraid (7.2.0)
     - Network share integration

4. **Infrastructure Decisions**
   - Implemented code-server for remote development
   - Established Git-based workflow for synchronization
   - Created export tools for worksheet metadata and context preservation

### Key Technical Decisions
1. **Module Organization**
   - Keep code consolidated during development phase
   - Structure for future modularization
   - Clear separation of concerns in preparation for later splitting

2. **Documentation Strategy**
   - Extensive inline documentation
   - Dependency tracking in code
   - Configuration-driven approach

3. **Development Environment**
   - Primary: code-server on Unraid
   - Git for version control
   - Automated metadata exports for context preservation

### Next Steps
1. Create VBA sync module for:
   - Monitoring file changes
   - Auto-backup to Old_Code with timestamps
   - Synchronizing modules between environments

2. Implement comprehensive logging system
   - Track development progress
   - Monitor system performance
   - Debug complex operations

3. Further develop Mode-Driven Search capabilities
   - Expand configuration options
   - Optimize search performance
   - Add new search modes as needed
